# Movie-Recommender-System
Here are some code i used for my movie recommending app. The code is messy because it includes my trials during the process. The data is from kaggle (movielens 1m).
I used surprise to train the data and joblib to save the models. I haven't uploaded the models because of the data limit. The front end part was done by my project 
partner, he recieved the data through the API written with flask.

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 0.95 ve MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 0.76 

A screenshot of the app:
